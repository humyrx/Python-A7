# Progess Updates
### 7/27 6:19 AM Humyra
A9 added to GitHub. It is still in progress. Code Listing 10.15 was copied and pasted. Only the make_data_set, sums_lists, make_averages, and train_classifier were modified and tested for the assignment. The rest of the code (from line 71 and onward) is from the textbook and has not been changed.  
For temporary testing purposes, a csv file containing only some of the data from diabetes.csv is created. This csv file is called test_data.csv.

### 7/27 7:19 AM Humyra
The code for A9 is complete and works accurately with test_data.csv. All that needs to be done is incorporation of diabetes.csv and how to split that file for training and testing. I think the professor discusses how he wants this done in the lecture?

# Notes
outcome = 0 means no diabetes  
pg 541 is the sample code  
pg 521 is where you see the 5 main functions that the professor is referring to in the assignment guidelines 


# Design Decisions
Choosing a data struct (pg 523)
Splitting diabetes.csv as 80:20. 80 for training and 20 for testing.
